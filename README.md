# Performance Benchmark Repo

This is just a collection of various benchmarks illustrating the performance benefits or pitfalls of different approaches.

Often these are the result of questions on Twitter or crazy ideas. 
So that others may benefit, I've created a repo to maintain here, rather than one-off test rigs on my machine only.

If you have any questions, I'm usually available in realtime at [@Nick_Craver](https://twitter.com/Nick_Craver)
